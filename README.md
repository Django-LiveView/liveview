**Build real-time, reactive interfaces with Django using WebSockets — write Python, not JavaScript.**

Django LiveView is a framework for creating interactive, real-time web applications entirely in Python, inspired by [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/) and [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/).

Create rich, dynamic user experiences with server-rendered HTML without writing a single line of JavaScript. Perfect for Django developers who want real-time features without the complexity of a separate frontend framework.
